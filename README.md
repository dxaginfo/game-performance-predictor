# Game Performance Predictor

A machine learning-powered web app that predicts player and team performance for upcoming basketball games based on historical data, matchup analysis, and contextual factors.

## Overview

Game Performance Predictor helps basketball analysts, coaches, fantasy players, and fans make more informed decisions by forecasting:

- Individual player stat lines
- Team scoring ranges
- Win probabilities
- Key matchup advantages
- Performance trend visualization

The application uses historical game data, player statistics, team dynamics, and contextual factors like rest days, home/away splits, and opponent strengths to generate predictions with confidence intervals.

- Matchup-specific adjustments
- Confidence intervals for each prediction

### Team Performance Prediction
- Expected score ranges
- Pace of play projections
- Win probability calculation
- Strength in specific statistical categories

### Matchup Analysis
